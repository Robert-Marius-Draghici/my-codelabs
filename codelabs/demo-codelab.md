Prerequesites
* API key
* Npm and Node.js

We recommend you to have npm and Node.js already installed on your machine to quickly boot up a http server.

Positive
: It is possible to have a single key(app) for all TomTom services, but you can also choose : to have individual keys for the different services.

Negative
: To get an API key you need register or sign in to TomTom Developer Portal. Request an evaluation API key to access the service you want to use the SDK with.
